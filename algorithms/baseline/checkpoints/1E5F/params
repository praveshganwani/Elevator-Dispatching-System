It learned to wait till many ppl are waiting, and then send all of them to their destinations,
then wait again for the many ppl waiting scenario

It learned to handle heavy traffic!!

It doesn't have too much experience with few ppl waiting case. So that it just accumulate waiting
ppl before making decisions
might need to tune down learning Rate
also set standard deviation before the softmax layer to be 0.01 to make sure enough randomness is given
at the beginning.

also use the correct simulation_hours + Q-learning factor pair

But weird, from the state it observes, it cannot tell the difference between all floors having 2 ppl waiting from each floor having 20 ppl waiting????
